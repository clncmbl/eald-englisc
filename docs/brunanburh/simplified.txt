Her æþelstan cyning and his broþor eac,

The second sentence might be translated as
"The sons of Edward cleaved shield walls and
hacked linden-shields with mill-sharpened
swords, as was inborn in them from ancestors
that they often defended land, treasure,
and homes in combat against each of the foes."
Rather complicated inherently but might be
able to simplify some of the vocabulary.
Try creating a list of all nouns, verbs, etc.
in the poem and use less variety for the same
meanings (for simplification).

Afaran Eadweardes bordweal clufan, heowan heaþolinde.

Sceotta leoda and scipflotan feollan.
Scottish and seamen fell.

Feld dænnede secga swate siðþan sunne up glad
oð heo sah to setle.
The field flowed with the blood of men from when the sun
glided up until it sank to rest.
