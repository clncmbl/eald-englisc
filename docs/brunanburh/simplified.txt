The second sentence might be translated as
"The sons of Edward cleaved shield walls and
hacked linden-shields with mill-sharpened
swords as was inborn in them from ancestors
so that they often defended land, treasure,
and homes in combat against each of the foes."
Rather complicated inherently but might be
able to simplify some of the vocabulary.
Try creating a list of all nouns, verbs, etc.
in the poem and use less variety for the same
meanings (for simplification).
