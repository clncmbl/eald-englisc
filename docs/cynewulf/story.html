The story of Cynewulf and Cyneheard appears in the Anglo-Saxon
Chronicles for the year 755.

(At this point in the Chronical, however, the entries are from
two to three years off.  Specifically, the Chronicle introduces
this error for entries that it says are for years 754 to 845.
The correct range for these entries is from 756 to 848.)

(TODO: The timespan of the events in the entry.)

The Chronicle is traditionally thought to have been started
during the reign of Alfred (871-899), which would mean that the
story was passed down orally or in writing for at least a few
generations before being written down in the Chronicle.

with him the longest.  Cynewulf then drove Sigebryht away to the
Andred forest where he remained until a swineherd stabbed him to
death at the stream at Privett, thereby avenging ealdorman
Cumbran.

<p>
As king, Cynewulf often fought in great battles against the
Britons.

<p>
Thirty one years into Cynewulf's rule, he decided to drive out an
atheling named Cyneheard, who was Sigebryht's brother.
Cyneheard, however, learned that the king, with a small
werod, went to visit a woman in Merton, and pursued him there.
Cyneheard and his men surrounded the detached chamber in which
the king was located before...
