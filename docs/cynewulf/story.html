The story of Cynewulf and Cyneheard appears in the Anglo-Saxon
Chronicles for the year 755.

(At this point in the Chronical,
however, the entries are from two to three years off.  Specifically,
the Chronicle introduces this error for entries that it
says are for years 754 to 845.  The correct range for these entries
is from 756 to 848.)

(TODO: The timespan of the events in the entry.)


The Chronicle is traditionally thought to have been started during
the reign of Alfred (871-899), which would mean that the story was
passed down orally or in writing for at least a few generations
before being written down in the Chronicle.

Some words:
atheling
ealdorman - a leader subordinate to the king.

    <h2>The story</h2>
Cynewulf and the West Saxon witan took from Sigebryht his
rule, except over Hamptonshire, for unrighteous deeds.
Sigebryht held Hamptonshire until he slew Cumbran, the aldorman
who had remained with him the longest.  Cynewulf then drove
Sigebryht
away to the Andred forest where he remained until a swineherd 
stabbed him to death at the stream at Privett, thereby
avenging the aldorman Cumbran.

As king, Cynewulf often fought in great battles against the
Britons.

Thirty one years into Cynewulf's rule, he decided to drive out
an atheling named Cyneheard, who was Sigebryht's brother.
