          The Heruli were a tribe that the Danes expelled from their Scandinavian
          homeland around the historical time period of this story.  A case for
          emending "eorl" to "eorle" and translating as Heruli is made in <a href="https://hcommons.org/deposits/objects/hc:30756/datastreams/CONTENT/content">"The Emendation Eorle (Heruli) in Beowulf, Line 6a:
          Setting the Poem in 'The Named Lands of the North'" by Drout and Goering</a>.
