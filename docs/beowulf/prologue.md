Listen! We have heard of the glory of the kings of the Spear-Danes of olden days,
how the princes showed courage.

Scyld Scefing often deprived enemy armies, many nations, of mead
benches.  He terrified nobles after he at first came to be destitute found.  He therefore
experienced comfort, grew under heaven, prospered
with glory, until every neighboring people beyond the sea had to listen to him,
pay tribute.  That was a good king!
```

**Hwæt!** - What! (in place of Listen! or Hark!)

### Wē Gār-Dena in geār-dagum þēod-cyninga þrym gefrūnon, hū þā æðelingas ellen fremedon.
We have heard of the glory of the kings of the Spear-Danes of olden days, how the princes showed courage.

#### Simple clauses
Wē þēod-cyninga þrym gefrūnon\
We have heard of the glory of the nation-kings.

Gār-Dena
: Spear-Danes (genitive plural)

þrym
: might or glory (se þrymm)

gefrūnon

We have heard of the glory of the kings of the Spear-Danes of olden days, how the princes showed courage.

The "nation" prefix on "nation-king" seems redundant.  The role of "þēod" might simply be to
provide poetic alliteration and rhythm.

geār-dagum
: olden days (year or yore followed by day in dative plural)

þēod-cyninga
: of kings of nations (nation king; þēod is nation and cyninga is king in genitive plural])

hū

### Oft Scyld Scēfing sceaðena þrēatum, monegum mǣgðum meodo-setla oftēah.
Often Scyld Scefing enemy armies, many nations, of mead-benches deprived.\
Scyld Scefing often deprived enemy armies, many nations of mead benches.

Re-ordering to resemble ModE prose:\
Oft Scyld Scēfing oftēah sceaðena þrēatum, monegum mǣgðum meodo-setla.

oft
: often

sceaðena
: (of) enemies (sceaþa, masc.; genitive plural)

þrēatum
: (from) armies (þréat, masc.; dative plural)

monegum
: many (manig; adjective; dative plural)

mǣgþum
: (from) tribes, nations (mǣgþ, fem.; dative plural)

meodo-setla
: mead benches (þæt medusetl; medu is mead and setl is seat; genitive plural)

oftēah
: deprived (somebody of something) (oftēon, tēon can be pull or drag, prefix "of" can be "from"; 3rd pers. sing. past.  According to Bosworth-Toller, with dat. or acc. of person, gen. of thing, or dat. of person and acc. of thing.)

### Egsode eorl,

egsode
: terrified (egsian; 3rd person singular past)

eorl
: "eorl" is typically edited to either Eorle, the Eruli tribe of Denmark, or eorlas, a noble rank. (se eorl; accusative plural)


### syððan ǣrest wearð fēa-sceaft funden: hē þæs frōfre gebād, wēox under wolcnum, weorð-myndum ðāh,

syððan
: after (since, after; conjugation.  According to Bosworth-Toller, syððan translates to "since" as a
conjunction "where the tense of the verb in the clause introduced by syððan is past, in the other clause
present," and translates to "after" "where the tense is the same in each clause.")

ǣrest
: first, at first (adverb)

wearð
: came to be (weorþan; 3rd person singular past)

fēa-sceaft
: destitute, miserable (adjective)

funden
: found (findan; past participle)

hē
: he

þæs
: that (genitive singular), OR afterwards, because of that, therefore, so (adverb, þæs in en.wiktionary.org )

frōfre
: consolation, comfort (frōfor, usually fem. singular G.D.I.A.) What preposition for translation?

gebād
: experienced (gebīdan, 3rd [and 1st] person singular past)

hē þæs frōfre gebād - he from that [time] met with comfort,  (from http://bosworth.ff.cuni.cz/013666).  Or, he therefore experienced comfort.

wēox
: grew (weaxan, 3rd [and 1st] person singular past)

under
: under (takes dative)

wolcnum
: clouds (seo wolcen or wolcn, plural dative; under wolcnum: under heaven?)

weorð-myndum
: (with?) honor, glory (seo weorð-mynd, plural dative;
"worth" comes from weorð and "mind" comes from mynd, so maybe
the compound means something about being worthy in people's
minds.)

ðāh
: prospered (þeon,  3rd [and 1st] person singular past)


### oð þæt him ǣghwylc þāra ymb-sittendra ofer hron-rāde hȳran scolde, gomban gyldan:      

oð þæt or oðþæt

hȳran
: to obey, listen (to) (when +dative)  (hyran or hieran)

scolde

gomban
: tribute (seo gombe; nominative plural or accusative singular)

gyldan
: to pay (alternative form of gieldan)

Might better punctuate literal translation as:\
Often Scyld Scefing enemy armies, many nations, of mead-benches deprived.  He terrified nobles after at first came to be destitute found.  He therefore comfort experienced, grew under heaven, with glory prospered, until to him every neighboring people beyond the sea had to listen, pay tribute.\
Oft Scyld Scēfing sceaþena þrēatum monegum mǣgþum meodosetla oftēah.  Egsode eorl\[as\] syððan ǣrest wearð fēa-sceaft funden.  Hē þæs frōfre gebād, wēox under wolcnum, weorðmyndum ðāh, oðþæt him æghwylc þāra ymbsittendra ofer hron-rāde hȳran scolde, gomban gyldan.

With 3rd-person singular verbs, I insert a "he" where it seems appropriate since other
similarly-inflected languages frequently have an implied subject where English has an
explicit one. 

Scyld Scefing often deprived enemy armies, many nations, of mead benches.  He terrified
nobles after he at first came to be destitute found.  He therefore experienced comfort,
grew under heaven, prospered with glory, until every neighboring people beyond the sea
had to listen to him, pay tribute.

Re-ordering to resemble ModE prose:\
Oft Scyld Scēfing meodosetla oftēah sceaþena þrēatum monegum mǣgþum. Egsode eorlas...

### Þæt wæs gōd cyning!
That was a good king!
